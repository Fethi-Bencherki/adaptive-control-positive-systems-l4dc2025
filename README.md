The code accompanies the paper "Adaptive Control of Positive Systems with Application to Learning SSP", presented at the 7th Annual Learning for Dynamics & Control Conference (L4DC) and published in the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR).

This repository contains code implementations of:

*sds
*sdsd

We compare the performance of these two algorithms in solving the Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problem.
