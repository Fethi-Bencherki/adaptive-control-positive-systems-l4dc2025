# Adaptive Control of Positive Systems with Application to Learning SSP

The code accompanies the paper **"Adaptive Control of Positive Systems with Application to Learning SSP"**, presented at the **7th Annual Learning for Dynamics & Control Conference (L4DC)** and published in the **Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)**.

## 📦 Repository Contents

This repository contains code implementations of:

- 📘 [The adaptive control algorithm described in the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17012)  
- 📗 [The Q-learning algorithm presented in the paper](https://web.mit.edu/dimitrib/www/Qlearning_Bounded_MOR.pdf)

## 🧪 Objective

We compare the performance of these two algorithms in solving the **Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP)** problem.
