The code accompanies the paper "Adaptive Control of Positive Systems with Application to Learning SSP", presented at the 7th Annual Learning for Dynamics & Control Conference (L4DC) and published in the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR).

This repository contains code implementations of:

*The adaptive control algorithm described in the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17012

*The Q-learning algorithm presented in the paper: https://web.mit.edu/dimitrib/www/Qlearning_Bounded_MOR.pdf

We compare the performance of these two algorithms in solving the Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problem.
