This repository contains code implementations of:
* The adaptive control algorithm described in the paper: \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17012}
* The Q-learning algorithm presented in the paper: \url{https://web.mit.edu/dimitrib/www/Qlearning_Bounded_MOR.pdf}
We compare the performance of these two algorithms in solving the Stochastic Shortest Path problem.
